  "Every refusal the tree can raise, checked for the two things that make a refusal
  usable: **a test provokes it**, and **a reader can look it up**.

  `type_contract_test` asserts the `:type` vocabulary — which words exist. This asks the
  next question of each word, and it is the question a list of names cannot answer: a
  keyword nothing throws at in a test is a branch nobody has run, and a keyword written
  down nowhere is a `:type` a caller meets in a `catch` with no way to find out what it
  means. Both failures are invisible to every other check here, because both leave the
  code compiling and the suite green.

  ## The two halves, and where each is satisfied

  - **Tested.** Some test provokes the refusal and discriminates on `:type` in its
    `ex-data`. The scan reads `test/` for a keyword literal sitting inside a top-level
    form that also reads `:type` or `ex-data` — a `deftest` is that form, so the two
    common spellings both count: the keyword compared in place
    (`(is (= :arity (:type (ex-data e))))`) and the type pulled out first and compared to
    a keyword a few lines down. It is a **floor, not a proof**: the scan cannot tell that
    the assertion is about *that* keyword, only that a test asserting on `:type` names it.
    What it does catch is the case worth catching — a refusal no test in the tree names
    at all.

  - **Written down.** The keyword appears in [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](../../docs/troubleshooting.md)
    or [`docs/defenses.md`](../../docs/defenses.md). The two are not interchangeable, and
    which one takes an entry follows from what each page is for: **troubleshooting is
    indexed by symptom**, so a refusal an operator or a caller meets belongs there, under
    the symptom that produced it or in the `:type` index that page closes with;
    **defenses is entry-by-entry with the code**, so a refusal belongs there only when the
    argument for refusing *rather than accepting* is the thing recorded here. Nearly
    every entry is troubleshooting's. A refusal whose mechanism is described on a
    subsystem page is documented there too — the index row is what makes it *findable*
    from the keyword alone, which is all a caller holding one has.

  ## On failure

  - **A refusal no test provokes.** Write the test — one that reaches the throw and
    checks the `:type` in its `ex-data`, never the message text. If the throw is genuinely
    out of a test's reach — it needs a crash at a precise instant, or a store damaged in a
    way no entry point can produce — add it to `unprovokable` with the one line saying why, the
    way `caches_test`'s `not-a-cache-bound` excuses a constant.
  - **A refusal written down nowhere.** Give it a row in troubleshooting's `:type` index,
    with what a caller would have observed and the page that owns the mechanism.
  - **An excuse for a refusal the tree no longer throws, or that a test now provokes.**
    Take the entry out. An excuse outliving its reason is what makes the next reader
    distrust the whole list."
